  * **What problem are we trying to solve?**
    
  Lack of on-demand large-item transport vehicles.

   * **Do many people experience this problem?**
   
    Yes, team members have experienced the problem and we assume that many other people do too.

   * **How are you solving the problem?**
   
    We aim to build a web app which brings van-drivers and van-needers together.

   * **User experience of our app**
   
    * Client user-experience
    
      - Login to app
      - select vehicle type
      - given ETA

      
    * Driver user-experience
    - mark themselves as available
    - customer request
        - driver accepts
        - complete
   * **Our ideal customer** 
    
      - Anyone without a large vehicle
    
      - Anyone not able to wait for a delivery
    
      - Driver who has the time to do extra deliveries
    
      - Someone working 9-5, not enough time to do pickup

      - Someone who needs to transport something(s) which wouldn't fit in a taxi or Uber, or be able to go with the parcel.
